Hi there, I'm Joel Asiago Guto, a backend engineer with a passion for crafting scalable and reliable systems. I specialize in building server-side applications using Python and JavaScript, with a strong focus on performance optimization and data modeling.

With vast experience in network and database engineering, I'm adept at designing and maintaining large-scale infrastructures that can handle high traffic and complex data requirements. I'm comfortable working with various database technologies, such as SQL and NoSQL databases, and can write efficient queries and data models that cater to specific business needs.

My expertise in backend engineering also extends to microservices architecture, RESTful APIs, and serverless computing. I enjoy building scalable and maintainable systems that can adapt to changing business needs and technology trends.

When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects or reading up on the latest tech news. Feel free to check out my GitHub profile and connect with me on LinkedIn!
